About zettel and zktrack biases Your study notes should follow the classic Zettelkasten format except that the last line should be the most obvious question to which the note answers. This will serve to make you work on answering (and then, remembering) rather than just passively reading. Here is an example of a personal study note that follows this format: ./\"el default view retorna programaticamente el window proxy que permite manipular al documento activo.md\" (filename) manipulando a travez del [[window es una interfaz perteneciente al DOM|window proxy que esta wrappeando al window]] al [[el documento activo es el documento que el navegador muestra al usuario|documento activo]] (note body) \u00bfQue retorna el default view expuesto en dom.window? (question) ZK Reviewed for now is biased to follow a \u201c1,2,7,14,30\u201d spaced review scheme where N equals the number of days from the last review to the next. This is intended to minimize the forgetting curve. Also, this is only supporting MD (but switch to another plain-text format should be easy, PR me ;) ). In general you should NOT review everything you study in this way, you should take advantage of this system to review the more theoretical and less implementable things in the short term, to retain them as long as possible until you can implement them properly.","title":"ZettelKasten (notes) Tracker"},{"location":"#zettelkasten-notes-tracker","text":"This is a simple tool for keeping track of your recent zettelkasten notes, with the aim of strengthening your memory through spaced review (type of spaced practice, a learning strategy you can learn about here. )","title":"ZettelKasten (notes) Tracker"},{"location":"#commands","text":"zktrack learn -> Track your new notes (maybe for your daily study sessions.) zktrack review -> Start reviewing 1 by 1 your notes. zktrack reviewed -> Mark your progress.","title":"Commands"},{"location":"#about-zettel-and-zktrack-biases","text":"Your study notes should follow the classic Zettelkasten format except that the last line should be the most obvious question to which the note answers.
